#Express Weather Finder

Express Weather Finder is meant to be a simple app that allows you to check the weather of just about any city in the world, as well as create and maintain a list of your favorite cities.

A user should be able to type in the name of a city, click "submit," and retrieve an approximate temperature reading for that particular city.

They should also be able to create a list of their favorite cities, which they can then edit or delete the entries based on preference.

To run the Weather Finder, run “node src/app.js” on localhost:3001. 
The API used for retrieving the weather temperatures is Open Weather Map (openweathermap.org)
